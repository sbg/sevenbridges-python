Quickstart
==========

On this page, you'll find a reference for the Seven Bridges API Python client.

We encourage you to consult our other API resources:

* The Seven Bridges Github repository, `okAPI <https://github.com/sbg/okAPI/tree/master/Recipes/SBPLAT>`_, which includes Python example scripts such as recipes (which allow you to perform specific tasks) and tutorials (which will walk you through entire analyses) via the API. These recipes and tutorials make use of the sevenbridges-python bindings below.
* The Seven Bridges API documentation on our `Knowledge Center <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api>`_, which includes a reference collection of API requests to help you get started right away.

Authentication and Configuration
--------------------------------

In order to authenticate with the API, you should pass the following items to sevenbridges-python:

(a) Your authentication token
(b) The API endpoint you will be interacting with. This is either the endpoint for the Seven Bridges Platform or for the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC).

You can find your authentication token on the respective pages:

-  https://igor.sbgenomics.com/developers for the Seven Bridges Platform
-  https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/developers for the CGC
-  https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/developer for Cavatica

The API endpoints for each environment are:

-  https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2 for the Seven Bridges Platform
-  https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2 for the CGC.
-  https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2 for CAVATICA


.. note:: We will see below how to supply information about your auth token and endpoint to the library.


For more information about the API, including details of the available parameters for each API call, you should check the API documentation before using this library:

-  http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api for the Seven Bridges Platform.
-  http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/the-cgc-api for the CGC.
-  http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/the-api for CAVATICA


How to use the Quickstart
-------------------------

We recommend that you pay particular attention to the section 'Managing Projects' of this Quickstart, since it contains general information on working with any kind of Platform or CGC resource (projects, files, tasks, etc) via the Python methods available in this library. 


Initializing the library
------------------------

Once you have obtained your authentication token from one of the URLs listed above, you can initialize the :code:`Api` object defined by this library by passing in your authentication token and endpoint. There are three methods to do this. Details of each method are given below:

1. Pass the parameters ``url`` and ``token`` and optional ``proxies`` explicitly when initializing the
   API object.
2. Set the API endpoint and token to the environment variables ``SB_API_ENDPOINT``
   and ``SB_AUTH_TOKEN`` respectively.
3. Use a configuration file ``$HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials`` with the defined credentials parameters. If config is used proxy settings will be read from
   ``$HOME/.sevenbridges/sevenbridges-python/config`` .ini like file for section ``[proxies]``

.. note:: Keep your authentication token safe! It encodes all your credentials on the Platform or CGC. Generally, we recommend storing the token in a configuration file, which will then be stored in your home folder rather than in the code itself. This prevents the authentication token from being committed to source code repositories.



Import the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should begin by importing the API library sevenbridges-python to your python script that will interact with the API:

.. code:: python

    import sevenbridges as sbg

Then, use one of the following three methods to initialize the library:

1. Initialize the library explicitly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library can be also instantiated explicitly by passing the URL and authentication token
as key-value arguments into the :code:`Api` object.

.. code:: python

    api = sbg.Api(url='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2', token='<TOKEN_HERE>')

*Note* - you can initialize several API clients with
different credentials or environments.

2. Initialize the library using environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import os
    
    # Usually these variables would be set in the shell beforehand
    os.environ['SB_API_ENDPOINT'] = '<https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2' # or 'https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2>' for cgc, or 'https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2' for cavatica
    os.environ['SB_AUTH_TOKEN'] = '<TOKEN_HERE>'

    api = sbg.Api()

3. Initialize the library using a configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The configuration file, ``$HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials``, has a simple ``.ini`` file format, with
the environment (the Seven Bridges Platform, or the CGC) indicated in square brackets, as shown:

::

    [default]
    api_endpoint = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2
    auth_token = <TOKEN_HERE>

    [cgc]
    api_endpoint = https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2
    auth_token = <TOKEN_HERE>
    
    [cavatica]
    api_endpoint = https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2
    auth_token = <TOKEN_HERE>


The :code:`Api` object is the central resource for querying, saving and
performing other actions on your resources on the Seven Bridges Platform or CGC. Once you have
instantiated the configuration class, pass it to the API class constructor.

.. code:: python

    c = sbg.Config(profile='cgc')
    api = sbg.Api(config=c)

If not profile is set it will use the default profile.

.. note:: if user creates the api object ``api=sbg.Api()`` and does not pass any information the
          library will first search whether the environment variables are set. If not it will check
          if the configuration file is present and read the ``[default]`` profile. If that also fails
          it will raise an exception

Proxy configuration
-------------------

Proxy configuration can be supplied in three different ways.

    - explicit initialization

    .. code:: python

     api = sb.Api(url='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2', token='<TOKEN_HERE>',
            proxies={'https_proxy':'host:port', 'http_proxy': 'host:port'})

    - environment variables

    .. code:: python

        os.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = 'host:port'
        os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'host:port'

    - `$HOME/.sevenbridges/sevenbridges-python/config` configuration file

    .. code::

        [proxies]
        https_proxy=host:port
        http_proxy=host:port

    - Explicit with config

    .. code::

        config = sb.Config(profile='my-profile',
                           proxies={'https_proxy':'host:port', 'http_proxy': 'host:port'})
        api = sb.Api(config=config)


.. note:: Once you set the proxy, all calls including upload and download will use the proxy settings.


Rate limit
----------

For API requests that require authentication (i.e. all requests, except the call to list possible API paths), you can issue a maximum of 1000
requests per 300 seconds. Note that this limit is generally subject to
change, depending on API usage and technical limits. Your current rate
limit, the number of remaining requests available within the limit, and the time until your limit is reset can be
obtained using your :code:`Api` object, as follows.

.. code:: python

    api.limit
    api.remaining
    api.reset_time


Error Handlers
--------------

Error handler is a callable that accepts the :code:`api` and :code:`response` objects and returns the response object.
They are most useful when additional logic needs to be implemented based on request result.

Example:

.. code::

    def error_handler(api, response):
        # Do something with the response object
        return response


sevenbridges-python library comes bundled with several useful error handlers. The most used ones
are :code:`maintenance_sleeper` and :code:`rate_limit_sleeper` which pause your code execution until the SevenBridges/CGC
public API is in maintenance mode or when the rate limit is breached.


Usage:

.. code::

    from sevenbridges.http.error_handlers import rate_limit_sleeper, maintenance_sleeper
    api = sb.Api(url='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2', token='<TOKEN_HERE>',
            error_handlers=[rate_limit_sleeper, maintenance_sleeper])


.. note:: Api object instantiated in this way with error handlers attached will be resilient to server maintenance and rate limiting.

Managing users
--------------

Currently any authenticated user can access his or her information by
invoking the following method:

.. code:: python

    me = api.users.me()

Once you have initialized the library by authenticating yourself, the object :code:`me` will contain your user information. This includes:

::

    me.href
    me.username 
    me.email
    me.first_name
    me.last_name
    me.affiliation
    me.phone
    me.address
    me.city
    me.state
    me.zip_code
    me.country

For example, to obtain your email address invoke:

.. code:: python

    me.email

Managing projects
-----------------

There are several methods on the :code:`Api` object that can help you manage
your projects.

.. note::  If you are not familiar with the project structure of the Seven Bridges Platform and CGC, take a look at their respective documentation: `projects on the CGC <http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/projects-on-the-cgc>`_ and `projects on the Seven Bridges Platform <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/projects-on-the-platform>`_.

List Projects - introduction to pagination and iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to list your projects, invoke the :code:`api.projects.query` method. This method
follows server pagination and therefore allows pagination parameters
to be passed to it. Passing a pagination parameter controls which resources you are shown. The :code:`offset` parameter controls the
start of the pagination while the :code:`limit` parameter controls the
number of items to be retrieved.


.. note:: See the `Seven Bridges API overview <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api>`_ or the `CGC API overview <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api>`_ for details of how to refer to a project, and for examples of the pagination parameters.

Below is an example of how to get all your projects, using the :code:`query` method and the pagination parameters :code:`offset` of 0 and :code:`limit` of 10.

.. code:: python

    project_list = api.projects.query(offset=0, limit=10)

:code:`project_list` has now been defined to be an object of the type **collection** which acts
just like a regular python list, and so supports
indexing, slicing, iterating and other list functions. All collections
in the sevenbridges-python library have two methods: :code:`next_page` and
:code:`previous_page` which allow you to load the next or previous pagination pages.

There are several things you can do with a **collection** of any kind of
object:

1. The generic query, e.g. ``api.projects.query()``, accepts the pagination parameters :code:`offset` and
   :code:`limit` as introduced above.
2. If you wish to iterate on a complete **collection** use the ``all()`` method,
   which returns an iterator
3. If you want to manually iterate on the **collection** (page by
   page), use ``next_page()`` and ``previous_page()`` methods on the
   collection.
4. You can easily cast the **collection** to the list, so you can re-use it
   later by issuing the standard Python
   ``project_list = list(api.projects.query().all())``.

.. code:: python

    # Get details of my first 10 projects.
    project_list = api.projects.query(limit=10)

.. code:: python

    # Iterate through all my projects and print their name and id
    for project in api.projects.query().all():
        print (project.id,project.name)

.. code:: python

    # Get all my current projects and store them in a list
    my_projects = list(api.projects.query().all())

Get details of a single project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get details of a single project by issuing the ``api.projects.get()`` method
with the parameter ``id`` set to the id of the project in question. Note that this
call, as well as other calls to the API server may raise an exception
which you can catch and process if required.


*Note* - To process errors from the library,
import :code:`SbgError` from ``sevenbridges.errors``, as shown below.

.. code:: python

    from sevenbridges.errors import SbgError
    try:
        project_id = 'doesnotexist/forsure'
        project = api.projects.get(id=project_id)
    except SbgError as e:
        print (e.message)

Errors in ``SbgError`` have the properties
``code`` and ``message`` which refer to the number and text of 4-digit API status codes that are specific to the Seven Bridges Platform and API. To see all the available codes, see the documentation:

-  http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/api-status-codes for the Seven Bridges
   Platform

-  http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/api-status-codes for the
   CGC.

Project properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have obtained the :code:`id` of a Project instance, you can see its properties. All projects have the following properties:


``href`` - Project href on the API 

``id`` - Id of the project

``name`` - name of the project

``description`` - description of the project

``billing_group`` - billing group attached to the project

``type`` - type of the project (v1 or v2)

``tags`` - list of project tags

The property href :code:`href` is a URL on the server that uniquely identifies the
resource in question. All resources have this attribute. Each project also
has a name, identifier, description indicating its use, a type, some tags and also a
billing\_group identifier representing the billing group that is
attached to the project.



Project methods -- an introduction to methods in the sevenbridges-python library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of methods in the sevenbridges-python library: static
and dynamic. Static methods are invoked on the :code:`Api` object instance.
Dynamic methods are invoked from the instance of the object representing the resource (e.g. the project).

Static methods include:

1. Create a new resource: for example,
   ``api.projects.create(name="My new project", billing_group='296a98a9-424c-43f3-aec5-306e0e41c799')``
   creates a new resource. The parameters used will depend on the resource in
   question.
2. Get a resource: the method ``api.projects.get(id='user/project')`` returns details of a
   specific resource, denoted by its id.
3. Query resources - the method ``api.projects.query()`` method returns a pageable
   list of type ``collection`` of projects. The same goes for other resources, so
   ``api.tasks.query(status='COMPLETED')`` returns a **collection** of
   completed tasks with default paging.

Dynamic methods can be generic (for all resources) or specific to a single resource. They
are called on a concrete object, such as a ``Project`` object.

So, suppose that ``project`` is an instance of ``Project`` object. Then, we can:

1. Delete the resource: ``project.delete()``  deletes the object (if deletion of this resource is supported
   on the API).
2. Reload the resource from server: ``project.reload()`` reloads the state of
   the object from the server.
3. Save changes to the server: ``project.save()`` saves all properties

The following example shows some of the methods used to manipulate projects.

.. code:: python

    # Get a collection of projects
    projects = api.projects.query()
    
    # Grab the first billing group 
    bg = api.billing_groups.query(limit=1)[0]
    
    # Create a project using the billing group grabbed above
    new_project = api.projects.create(name="My new project", billing_group=bg.id)
    
    # Add a new member to the project
    new_project.add_member(user='newuser', permissions= {'write':True, 'execute':True})

Other project methods include:

1. Get members of the project and their permissions -
   ``project.get_members()`` - returns a ``Collection`` of members and
   their permissions
2. Add a member to the project - ``project.add_member()``
3. Remove a member from the project - ``project.remove_member()``
4. List files from the project - ``project.get_files()``
5. Add files to the project - ``project.add_files()`` - you can add a
   single ``File`` or a ``Collection`` of files
6. List apps from the project - ``project.get_apps()``
7. List tasks from the project - ``project.get_tasks()``

Manage billing
--------------

There are several methods on the :code:`Api` object to can help you manage
your billing information. The billing resources that you can interact with are
*billing groups* and *invoices*.

Manage billing groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Querying billing groups will return a standard **collection** object.

.. code:: python

    # Query billing groups
    bgroup_list = api.billing_groups.query(offset=0, limit=10)

.. code:: python

    # Fetch a billing group's information
    bg = api.billing_groups.get(id='f1969c90-da54-4118-8e96-c3f0b49a163d')

Billing group properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties are attached to each billing group:


``href`` - Billing group href on the API server.
        
``id`` - Billing group identifier.

``owner`` - Username of the user that owns the billing group.

``name`` - Billing group name.

``type`` - Billing group type (free or regular)

``pending`` - True if billing group is not yet approved, False if the billing group has been approved.

``disabled`` - True if billing group is disabled, False if its enabled.

``balance`` - Billing group balance.


Billing group methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is one billing group method:

``breakdown()`` fetches a cost breakdown by project and analysis for the selected billing
group.

Manage invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Querying invoices will return an Invoices **collection** object.

.. code:: python

    invoices = api.invoices.query()

Once you have obtained the invoice identifier you can also fetch specific
invoice information.

.. code:: python

    invoices = api.invoices.get(id='6351830069')

Invoice properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties are attached to each invoice.

``href`` - Invoice href on the API server.

``id`` - Invoice identifier.

``pending`` - Set to ``True`` if invoice has not yet been approved by Seven Bridges, ``False`` otherwise.

``analysis_costs`` - Costs of your analysis.

``storage_costs`` - Storage costs.

``total`` - Total costs.

``invoice_period`` - Invoicing period (from-to)

Managing files
--------------

Files are an integral part of each analysis. As for as all other resources, the
sevenbridges-python library enables you to effectively query files, in order to retrieve each file's details and metadata. The request to get a file's information can be made in the
same manner as for projects and billing, presented above. 

The available methods for fetching specific files are ``query`` and ``get``:

.. code:: python

    # Query all files in a project
    file_list = api.files.query(project='user/my-project')

.. code:: python

    # Get a single file's information
    file = api.files.get(id='5710141760b2b14e3cc146af')

File properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each file has the following properties:

``href`` - File href on the API server.

``id`` - File identifier.

``name`` - File name.

``size`` - File size in bytes.

``project`` - Identifier of the project that file is located in.

``created_on`` - Date of the file creation.

``modified_on`` - Last modification of the file.

``origin`` - File origin information, indicating the task that created the file.

``tags`` - File tags.

``metadata`` - File metadata.

File methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Files have the following methods:

-  Refresh the file with data from the server: ``reload()``
-  Copy the file from one project to another: ``copy()``
-  Download the file: ``download()``
-  Save modifications to the file to the server ``save()``
-  Delete the resource: ``delete()``


See the examples below for information on the arguments these methods take:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Filter files by name to find only file names containing the specified string:
    files = api.files.query(project='user/my-project')
    my_file = [file for file in files if 'fasta' in file.name]
    
    # Or simply query files by name if you know their exact file name(s)
    files = api.files.query(project='user/myproject', names=['SRR062634.filt.fastq.gz','SRR062635.filt.fastq.gz'])
    my_files = api.files.query(project='user/myproject', metadata = {'sample_id': 'SRR062634'} )
    
    
    # Edit a file's metadata
    my_file = my_files[0]
    my_file.metadata['sample_id'] = 'my-sample'
    my_file.metadata['library'] = 'my-library'
    

    # Add metadata (if you are starting with a file without metadata)
    my_file = my_files[0]
    my_file.metadata = {'sample_id' : 'my-sample',
                        'library' : 'my-library'
                      }
                      
    # Also set a tag on that file
    my_file.tags = ['example']
   
    # Save modifications
    my_file.save()
    
    # Copy a file between projects
    new_file = my_file.copy(project='user/my-other-project', name='my-new-file')
    
    # Download a file to the current working directory
    # Optionally, path can contain a full path on local filesystem
    new_file.download(path='my_new_file_on_disk')

Managing file upload and download
---------------------------------

``sevenbridges-python`` library provides both synchronous and asynchronous
way of uploading or downloading files.

File Download
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synchronous file download:

.. code:: python

    file = api.files.get('file-identifier')
    file.download('/home/bar/foo/file.bam')

Asynchronous file download:

.. code:: python

    file = api.files.get('file-identifier')
    download = file.download('/home/bar/foo.bam', wait=False)

    download.path # Gets the target file path of the download.
    download.status # Gets the status of the download.
    download.progress # Gets the progress of the download as percentage.
    download.start_time # Gets the start time of the download.
    download.duration # Gets the download elapsed time.

    download.start() # Starts the download.
    download.pause() # Pauses the download.
    download.resume() # Resumes the download.
    download.stop() # Stops the download.
    download.wait() # Block the main loop until download completes.

You can register the callback or error callback function to the
download handle: ``download.add_callback(callback=my_callback, errorback=my_error_back)``

Registered callback method will be invoked on completion of the download. The errorback
method will be invoked if error happens during download.

File Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~

Synchronous file upload:

.. code:: python

    # Get the project where we want to upload files.
    project = api.projects.get('project-identifier')
    api.files.upload('/home/bar/foo/file.fastq', project)
    # Optionally we can set file name of the uploaded file.
    api.files.upload('/home/bar/foo/file.fastq', project, file_name='new.fastq')

Asynchronous file upload:

.. code:: python

    upload = api.files.upload('/home/bar/foo/file.fastq', 'project-identifier', wait=False)

    upload.file_name # Gets the file name of the upload.
    upload.status # Gets the status of the upload.
    upload.progress # Gets the progress of the upload as percentage.
    upload.start_time # Gets the start time of the upload.
    upload.duration # Gets the upload elapsed time.

    upload.start() # Starts the upload.
    upload.pause() # Pauses the upload.
    upload.resume() # Resumes the upload.
    upload.stop() # Stops the upload.
    upload.wait() # Block the main loop until upload completes.

You can register the callback or error callback in the same manner as it
was described for asynchronous file download.


Managing volumes: connecting cloud storage to the Platform
----------------------------------------------------------

Volumes authorize the Platform to access and query objects on a specified cloud storage (Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Storage) on your behalf. As for as all other resources, the sevenbridges-python library enables you to effectively query volumes, import files from a volume to a project or export files from a project to the volume. 

The available methods for listing volumes, imports and exports are ``query`` and ``get``, as for other objects:

.. code:: python

    # Query all volumes 
    volume_list = api.volumes.query()
    # Query all imports
    all_imports = api.imports.query()
    # Query failed exports
    failed_exports = api.exports.query(state='FAILED')

.. code:: python

    # Get a single volume's information
    volume = api.volumes.get(id='user/volume')
    # Get a single import's information
    i = api.imports.get(id='08M4ywDZkQuJOb3L5M8mMSvzoeGezTdh')
    # Get a single export's information
    e = api.exports.get(id='0C7T8sBDP6aiNbwvXv12QZFPW55wJ3GJ')


Volume properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each volume has the following properties:

``href`` - Volume href on the API server.

``id`` - Volume identifier in format owner/name.

``name`` - Volume name. Learn more about this in our `Knowledge Center <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/volumes#section-volume-name>`_.

``access_mode`` - Whether the volume was created as read-only (RO) or read-write (RW). Learn more about this in our `Knowledge Center <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/volumes#section-access-mode>`_.

``active`` - Whether or not this volume is active.

``created_on`` - Time when the volume was created.

``modified_on`` - Time when the volume was last modified.

``description`` - An optional description of this volume.

``service`` - This object contains the information about the cloud service that this volume represents.

Volume methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Volumes have the following methods:

-  Refresh the volume with data from the server: ``reload()``
-  Get imports for a particular volume ``get_imports()``
-  Get exports for a particular volume ``get_exports()``
-  Create a new volume based on the AWS S3 service -  ``create_s3_volume()``
-  Create a new volume based on Google Cloud Storage service  - ``create_google_volume()``
-  Save modifications to the volume to the server ``save()``
-  Unlink the volume ``delete()``

See the examples below for information on the arguments these methods take:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Create a new volume based on AWS S3 for importing files
    volume_import = api.volumes.create_s3_volume(name='my_input_volume', bucket='my_bucket',access_key_id='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',secret_access_key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',access_mode='RO')

    # Create a new volume based on AWS S3 for exporting files
    volume_export = api.volumes.create_s3_volume(name='my_output_volume', bucket='my_bucket', access_key_id='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',secret_access_key = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',access_mode='RW')
    # List all volumes available
    volumes = api.volumes.query()
     

Import properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you import a file from a volume into a project on the Platform,  you are importing a file from your cloud storage provider (Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Storage) via the volume onto the Platform.

If successful, an alias will be created on the Platform. Aliases appear as files on the Platform and can be copied, executed, and modified as such. They refer back to the respective file on the given volume.

Each import has the following properties:

``href`` - Import href on the API server.

``id`` - Import identifier.

``source`` - Source of the import, object of type ``VolumeFile``, contains info on volume and file location on the volume

``destination`` - Destination of the import, object of type ``ImportDestination``, containing info on project where the file was imported to and name of the file in the project

``state`` - State of the import. Can be *PENDING*, *RUNNING*, *COMPLETED* and *FAILED*.

``result`` - If the import was completed, contains the result of the import - a ``File`` object.

``error`` - Contains the ``Error`` object if the import failed.

``overwrite`` - Whether the import was set to overwrite file at destination or not.

``started_on`` - Contains the date and time when the import was started.

``finished_on`` - Contains the date and time when the import was finished.

Import methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imports have the following methods:

-  Refresh the import with data from the server: ``reload()``
-  Start an import  by specifying the source and the destination of the import - ``submit_import()``
-  Delete the import -  ``delete()``

See the examples below for information on the arguments these methods take:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Import a  file to a project
    my_project = api.projects.get(id='my_project')
    bucket_location = 'fastq/my_file.fastq'
    imp = api.imports.submit_import(volume=volume_import, project=my_project, location=bucket_location)
    # Wait until the import finishes
    while True:
          import_status = imp.reload().state
          if import_status in (ImportExportState.COMPLETED, ImportExportState.FAILED):
               break
          time.sleep(10)
    # Continue with the import
    if imp.state == ImportExportState.COMPLETED:
          imported_file = imp.result


Export properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you export a file from a project on the Platform into a volume, you are essentially writing to your cloud storage bucket on Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Storage via the volume.

Note that the file selected for export must not be a public file or an alias. Aliases are objects stored in your cloud storage bucket which have been made available on the Platform.

The volume you are exporting to must be configured for read-write access. To do this, set the ``access_mode`` parameter to ``RW`` when creating or modifying a volume. Learn more about this from our `Knowledge Center <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/volumes#section-access-mode>`_.

Each export has the following properties:

``href`` - Export href on the API server.

``id`` - Export identifier.

``source`` - Source of the export, object of type ``File``

``destination`` - Destination of the export, object of type ``VolumeFile``, containing info on project where the file was imported to and name of the file in the project

``state`` - State of the export. Can be *PENDING*, *RUNNING*, *COMPLETED* and *FAILED*.

``result`` - If the export was completed, this contains the result of the import - a ``File`` object.

``error`` - Contains the ``Error`` object if the export failed.

``overwrite`` - Whether or not the export was set to overwrite the file at the destination.

``started_on`` - Contains the date and time when the export  was started.

``finished_on`` - Contains the date and time when the export was finished.

Export methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exports have the following methods:

-  Refresh the export with data from the server: ``reload()``
-  Submit export, by specifying source and destination of the import: ``submit_import()``
-  Delete the export: ``delete()``

See the examples below for information on the arguments these methods take:


Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Export a set of files to a volume
    # Get files from a project
    files_to_export = api.files.query(project=my_project).all()
    # And export all the files to the output bucket
    exports = []
    for f in files_to_export:
          export = api.exports.submit_export(file=f, volume = volume_export, location=f.name)
          exports.append(export)
    # Wait for exports to finish:
    num_exports = len(exports)
    done = False
    
    while not done:
          done_len = 0 
          for e in exports:
                 if e.reload().state in (ImportExportState.COMPLETED, ImportExportState.FAILED):
                        done_len += 1
                 time.sleep(10)
          if done_len == num_exports:
                 done = True
    
Managing apps
-------------

Managing apps (tools and workflows) with the sevenbridges-python library is simple. Apps on the Seven
Bridges Platform and CGC are implemented using the Common Workflow Language (CWL)
specification
https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language.
The sevenbridges-python currently supports only Draft 2 format of the
CWL.
Each app has a CWL description, expressed in JSON.

Querying all apps or getting the details of a single app can be done in the same
way as for other resources, using the ``query()`` and ``get`` methods. You
can also invoke the following class-specific methods:

-  ``get_revision()`` - Returns a specific app revision.
-  ``install_app()`` - Installs your app on the server, using its CWL description.
-  ``create_revision()`` - Creates a new revision of the specified app.

.. note:: Listing public apps can be achieved by invoking ``api.apps.query(visibility='public')``

App properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each app has the following available properties:

``href`` - The URL of the app on the API server.

``id`` - App identifier.

``name`` - App name.

``project`` - Identifier of the project that app is located in.

``revision`` - App revision.

``raw`` - Raw CWL description of the app.

App methods
~~~~~~~~~~~

- App only has class methods that were mentioned above.

Managing tasks
--------------

Tasks (pipeline executions) are easy to handle using the sevenbridges-python library. As with all
resources you can ``query()`` your tasks, and ``get()`` a single task
instance. You can also do much more. We will outline task properties and
methods and show in the examples how easy is to run your first analysis using Python.

Task properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``href`` - Task URL on the API server.

``id`` - Task identifier.

``name`` - Task name.

``status`` - Task status.

``project`` - Identifier of the project that the task is located in.

``app`` - The identifier of the app that was used for the task.

``type`` - Task type.

``created_by`` - Username of the task creator.

``executed_by``- Username of the task executor.

``batch`` - Boolean flag: ``True`` for batch tasks, ``False`` for regular &
child tasks.

``batch_by`` - Batching criteria.

``batch_group`` - Batch group assigned to the child task calculated from
the ``batch_by`` criteria.

``batch_input`` - Input identifier on to which to apply batching.

``parent`` - Parent task for a batch child.

``end_time`` - Task end time.

``execution_status`` - Task execution status.

``price`` - Task cost.

``inputs`` - Inputs that were submitted to the task.

``outputs`` - Generated outputs from the task.



.. note:: Check the documentation on the `Seven Bridges API <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-task>`_ and the `CGC API <http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/create-a-new-task>`_ for more details on batching criteria. 



Task methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following class and instance methods are available for tasks:

-  Create a task on the server and, optionally, run it: ``create()``.
-  Query tasks: ``query()``.
-  Get single task's information: ``get()``.
-  Abort a running task: ``abort()``.
-  Run a draft task: ``run()``
-  Delete a draft task from the server: ``delete()``.
-  Refresh the task object information with the date from the server:
   ``refresh()``.
-  Save task modifications to the sever: ``save()``.
-  Get task execution details: ``get_execution_details()``.
-  Get batch children if the task is a batch task:
   ``get_batch_children()``.

Task creation hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Both input files and parameters are passed the same way together in a single dictionary to ``inputs``.
- ``api.files.query`` always return an array of files. For single file inputs, use ``api.files.query(project='my-project', names=["one_file.fa"])[0]``.


Task Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single task
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Task name
    name = 'my-first-task'
    
    # Project in which I want to run a task.
    project = 'my-username/my-project'
    
    # App I want to use to run a task
    app = 'my-username/my-project/my-app'
    
    # Inputs
    inputs = {}
    inputs['FastQC-Reads'] = api.files.query(project='my-project', metadata={'sample': 'some-sample'})
    
    try:
        task = api.tasks.create(name=name, project=project, app=app, inputs=inputs, run=True)
    except SbError:
        print('I was unable to run the task.')
    
    # Task can also be ran by invoking .run() method on the draft task.
    task.run()

Batch task
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Task name
    name = 'my-first-task'
    
    # Project in which to run the task.
    project = 'my-username/my-project'
    
    # App to use to run the task
    app = 'my-username/my-project/my-app'
    
    # Inputs
    inputs = {}
    inputs['FastQC-Reads'] = api.files.query(project=project, metadata={'sample': 'some-sample'})
    
    # Specify that one task should be created per file (i.e. batch tasks by file).
    batch_by = {'type': 'item'}
    
    
    # Specify that the batch input is FastQC-Reads
    batch_input = 'FastQC-Reads'
    
    try:
        task = api.tasks.create(name=name, project=project, app=app, 
                                inputs=inputs, batch_input=batch_input, batch_by=batch_by, run=True)
    except SbError:
        print('I was unable to run a batch task.')
